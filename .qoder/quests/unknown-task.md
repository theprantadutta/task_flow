# TaskFlow - Feature Enhancement and UI Improvement Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for enhancing the TaskFlow application with the following key improvements:

1. **Profile Data Persistence**: Replace dummy data in the profile screen with real data from Firebase Firestore
2. **Workspace and Project Management**: Implement update and delete functionality for workspaces and projects
3. **Task Management System**: Complete implementation of the task management system with full CRUD operations
4. **UI/UX Improvements**: Fix dark mode contrast issues, particularly in the bottom navigation bar

These enhancements will improve the application's functionality, data integrity, and user experience, making it a more robust and production-ready project management tool.

## 2. Repository Type

This is a **Mobile Application** built with Flutter, targeting both Android and iOS platforms with a focus on collaborative project management.

## 3. Feature Requirements Analysis

### 3.1 Profile Data Persistence
Currently, the profile screen uses hardcoded dummy data for profile statistics (projects, tasks, workspaces). This needs to be replaced with real data fetched from Firebase Firestore based on the user's actual data.

### 3.2 Workspace and Project Management
While create and read operations exist for workspaces and projects, update and delete functionality is either missing or not fully implemented in the UI layer.

### 3.3 Task Management System
The task management system is partially implemented but lacks full functionality for updating and deleting tasks. The current implementation also has placeholder code for some operations.

### 3.4 UI/UX Improvements
The dark mode theme has contrast issues, particularly with the bottom navigation bar where the selected item color does not provide sufficient contrast against the background. Additionally, the Create Project modal experiences bottom overflow when the keyboard appears, making it difficult for users to interact with form fields.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Component Architecture

The application follows a feature-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- MainScreen: Central navigation hub with bottom navigation bar
- EnhancedBottomNavigationBar: Custom navigation component
- DashboardScreen: Overview of user activities
- WorkspaceListScreen: Management of workspaces
- ProjectListScreen: Management of projects
- TasksScreen: Personal task management
- ProfileScreen: User profile and settings

Each screen connects to dedicated service classes that handle data operations with Firebase Firestore.

### 4.2 Data Flow Architecture

User interactions flow through the component hierarchy:

1. User interacts with UI components
2. UI components communicate with service layer
3. Services perform operations on Firebase Firestore
4. Data changes trigger UI updates

This unidirectional data flow ensures predictable state management and clear separation of concerns.

## 5. Detailed Feature Implementation

### 5.1 Profile Data Persistence

#### Current State
The profile screen displays hardcoded statistics for projects, tasks, and workspaces rather than fetching real data from Firestore.

#### Implementation Plan
1. Modify the UserService to include methods for calculating user statistics
2. Update the ProfileScreen to fetch real statistics from Firestore
3. Replace hardcoded values with dynamic data

#### Data Model
The User model already exists with uid, email, displayName, and photoURL fields. We need to add methods to calculate statistics based on related collections.

### 5.2 Workspace Management Enhancement

#### Current State
- Create workspace: Implemented
- Read workspaces: Implemented
- Update workspace: Service method exists but not exposed in UI
- Delete workspace: Service method exists but not exposed in UI

#### Implementation Plan
1. Add update and delete functionality to WorkspaceListScreen
2. Create WorkspaceDetailScreen with edit and delete options
3. Implement proper confirmation dialogs for delete operations
4. Add refresh mechanisms to update UI after operations

#### UI Components
- Workspace detail screen with edit form
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Edit workspace form
- Context menu for workspace actions

### 5.3 Project Management Enhancement

#### Current State
- Create project: Implemented
- Read projects: Implemented
- Update project: Service method exists but not exposed in UI
- Delete project: Service method exists but not exposed in UI

#### Implementation Plan
1. Add update and delete functionality to ProjectListScreen
2. Create ProjectDetailScreen with edit and delete options
3. Implement proper confirmation dialogs for delete operations
4. Add refresh mechanisms to update UI after operations

#### UI Components
- Project detail screen with edit form
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Edit project form
- Context menu for project actions

### 5.4 Task Management System Completion

#### Current State
- Create task: Partially implemented
- Read tasks: Implemented
- Update task: Service method exists but not fully integrated
- Delete task: Partially implemented with placeholder code

#### Implementation Plan
1. Complete task creation workflow with proper workspace/project selection
2. Implement task editing functionality
3. Complete task deletion with proper Firestore integration
4. Add task detail screen
5. Implement task status updates with drag-and-drop functionality

#### UI Components
- Task detail screen
- Edit task form
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Enhanced task cards with action buttons
- Improved Kanban board with drag-and-drop

### 5.5 UI/UX Improvements - Dark Mode Contrast and Modal Fix

#### Current State
The dark theme bottom navigation bar has insufficient contrast, making it difficult to distinguish between selected and unselected items. The Create Project modal experiences bottom overflow when the keyboard appears.

#### Implementation Plan
1. Update the dark theme colors for better contrast
2. Ensure all UI components have proper contrast ratios
3. Fix bottom overflow issue in Create Project modal by using proper scrollable containers
4. Implement responsive layouts that adapt to keyboard visibility
5. Test with accessibility tools to verify compliance

#### Color Changes
- Selected item color: Change from deepPurple to a lighter variant or white
- Unselected item color: Change from grey to a lighter grey for better visibility
- Background color: May need adjustment for better overall contrast

## 6. Data Models & Service Layer

### 6.1 User Model Enhancement
