# TaskFlow - Team Productivity & Project Management App Implementation Design

## 1. Overview

TaskFlow is a collaborative project management application built with Flutter and Firebase, designed to help teams organize and track their work through an intuitive Kanban-style interface. The application will implement a comprehensive set of features including user authentication, workspace management, real-time task tracking, role-based access control, and push notifications. Server-side logic will be handled through a separate Python backend instead of Firebase Cloud Functions, providing more flexibility and control over business logic implementation.

### 1.1 Key Features
- User authentication with email/password and Google Sign-In
- User profile management with profile picture upload
- Workspace creation and team member invitations
- Real-time Kanban board with drag-and-drop task management
- Role-based access control (Admin/Member permissions)
- Push notifications for task assignments and updates
- Analytics for tracking user engagement
- Scheduled tasks and background processing through Python backend

### 1.2 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter SDK with Material Design
- **State Management**: Bloc pattern for scalable state management
- **Backend**: Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Messaging)
- **External Backend**: Python Flask/FastAPI for server-side logic
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics and Performance Monitoring

### 1.3 Firebase Setup Requirements
Based on the project analysis, Firebase is partially configured but requires:
- Firebase project configuration files (google-services.json for Android, GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS)
- Firebase initialization in the Flutter application
- Proper Firebase service dependencies in pubspec.yaml

### 1.4 Firebase Configuration Process
1. Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase Console
2. Add Android app to the Firebase project with package name `com.pranta.taskflow`
3. Download and add `google-services.json` to `android/app/` directory
4. Add iOS app to the Firebase project
5. Download and add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner/` directory
6. Install FlutterFire CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
7. Configure FlutterFire: `flutterfire configure`
8. Update pubspec.yaml with required Firebase dependencies
9. Generate and download service account key for Firebase Admin SDK
10. Configure Firebase Admin SDK in Python backend

## 2. Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers. The architecture is designed to support real-time data synchronization and scalable cloud-based functionality.

## 3. Component Architecture

### 3.1 Feature-Based Folder Structure
The application will be organized using a feature-based structure for better maintainability and scalability:

```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── firebase_options.dart
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── themes/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── profile/
│   ├── workspace/
│   ├── project/
│   └── task/
├── shared/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── widgets/
│   └── services/
└── routes/
```

### 3.2 Core Components

#### 3.2.1 Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User
participant App as Flutter App
participant Auth as Firebase Auth
User->>App : Open Application
App->>Auth : Check Authentication State
Auth-->>App : Return Auth State
alt User Not Authenticated
App->>User : Show Login Screen
User->>App : Enter Credentials
App->>Auth : signInWithEmailAndPassword()
Auth-->>App : Return User Credentials
App->>App : Navigate to Home Screen
else User Authenticated
App->>App : Navigate to Home Screen
end
```

#### 3.2.2 State Management with Bloc
The application will use the Bloc pattern for state management, with each feature having its own Bloc:

```mermaid
classDiagram
class AuthBloc {
+Stream<AuthState> state
+void add(AuthEvent event)
+void mapEventToState(AuthEvent event)
}
class AuthState {
<<abstract>>
}
class AuthInitial {
+AuthInitial()
}
class AuthLoading {
+AuthLoading()
}
class Authenticated {
+User user
}
class Unauthenticated {
+Unauthenticated()
}
class AuthEvent {
<<abstract>>
}
class AuthStarted {
+AuthStarted()
}
class AuthLoggedIn {
+User user
}
class AuthLoggedOut {
+AuthLoggedOut()
}
AuthState <|-- AuthInitial
AuthState <|-- AuthLoading
AuthState <|-- Authenticated
AuthState <|-- Unauthenticated
AuthEvent <|-- AuthStarted
AuthEvent <|-- AuthLoggedIn
AuthEvent <|-- AuthLoggedOut
AuthBloc --> AuthState
AuthBloc --> AuthEvent
```

## 4. Data Models & Firestore Structure

```

### 4.2 Firestore Collections Structure
- **users/** - User profiles
- **workspaces/** - Workspace documents
  - **members/** - Subcollection for workspace members
  - **projects/** - Subcollection for projects
    - **tasks/** - Subcollection for tasks

## 5. Business Logic Layer

### 5.1 Authentication Logic
- Email/password authentication
- Google Sign-In integration
- User state persistence
- Password reset flow

## 6. UI/UX Design

### 6.1 Screen Hierarchy
- Splash Screen
- Authentication Screens (Login/Signup)
- Onboarding/Profile Setup
- Workspace Dashboard
- Project View (Kanban Board)
- Task Detail View
- User Profile

### 6.2 Kanban Board Implementation

classDiagram
class KanbanBoard {
+List<Column> columns
+StreamSubscription taskSubscription
+initRealTimeListener()
+updateTaskStatus()
}
class TaskColumn {
+String title

+Future<void> createTask(task)
}
KanbanBoard --> TaskColumn : "contains"
TaskColumn --> Task : "contains"
KanbanBoard --> TaskService : "uses"
TaskService --> Firestore : "communicates with"
```

### 6.3 Drag-and-Drop Implementation
The drag-and-drop functionality will be implemented using Flutter's `Draggable` and `DragTarget` widgets:
- Tasks will be wrapped in `Draggable` widgets
- Columns will be implemented as `DragTarget` widgets
- Upon drop, the task status will be updated in Firestore
- Real-time listeners will update all clients with the new task status

## 7. Firebase Integration

### 7.1 Firebase Authentication
- Implementation of email/password authentication
- Google Sign-In integration using Firebase Auth
- User state management with StreamBuilder
- Password reset functionality

### 7.2 Cloud Firestore
- Real-time listeners for instant UI updates
- Efficient querying for task and project data
- Offline persistence for improved user experience
- Data validation and security rules

### 7.3 Firebase Storage
- Profile picture upload and storage
- Image compression for optimal performance
- Secure download URLs for profile images

### 7.4 Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Push notifications for task assignments
- Background and foreground notification handling
- Device token management

### 7.5 Alternative Approaches for Server-Side Logic
Instead of using Firebase Cloud Functions, server-side logic will be handled through a Python Flask/FastAPI backend service for handling notifications, data processing, and scheduled tasks.

For handling scheduled messages and background tasks without Firebase Cloud Functions:

**Python Approach:**
1. Create a Python Flask/FastAPI application
2. Use APScheduler for job scheduling
3. Use Firebase Admin SDK for Python to send FCM notifications
4. Deploy to Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Run

### 7.6 Firebase Security Rules
The Firebase security rules for workspaces will implement version 2 of the rules language. They will ensure that only authenticated users can read or write workspace documents, and that users can only access workspaces where they are members. For workspace members, read access will be allowed for all authenticated users, while write access will be restricted based on user roles, with admins having broader permissions than regular members.

Since we're not using Cloud Functions, security rules become even more important to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive operations like user management and task assignments.
