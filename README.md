## Python Backend

The `python_backend` directory contains a Flask application that handles server-side logic:

```
python_backend/
├── app.py              # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── notification_service.py  # FCM notification service
├── task_scheduler.py   # Scheduled task management
├── setup.py            # Setup script
└── run.py              # Run script
```

## Getting Started

1. **Flutter Setup**:
   ```bash
