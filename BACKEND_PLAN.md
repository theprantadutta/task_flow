   - Bulk notification capabilities
   - Service account key management

2. **Task Scheduler**
   - APScheduler integration for job scheduling
   - Basic scheduled task framework
   - Task execution management

3. **Firebase Admin SDK Integration**
   - Authentication with service account keys
   - Access to Firebase services (Firestore, FCM, etc.)

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable support via python-dotenv
   - Firebase configuration extraction from Flutter project
   - Virtual environment setup

### Current Architecture
```
